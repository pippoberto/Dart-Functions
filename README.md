# Dart Functions Repository

This repository serves as a collection of various Dart functions that can be used to enhance the functionality of Flutter apps. It provides a wide range of functions that can be integrated into your projects, adding specific features and capabilities.

## Examples

### [Geographic Distance Calculator](https://github.com/pippoberto/Dart-Functions/blob/main/calculateDistance.dart)
This code provides a function to calculate the distance between two geographic positions on the Earth's surface using the Haversine formula. The Haversine formula is commonly used to calculate distances between two points on a sphere, such as the Earth.
### [Random Number Generator](https://github.com/pippoberto/Dart-Functions/blob/main/randomNumber.dart)
This code provides a function to generate a random number between 1 and 2147483647 (the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer in Dart). 
I used it to generate a random seed for image generation with some stable diffusion APIs.
### [Image Upload to Firebase Storage](https://github.com/pippoberto/Dart-Functions/blob/main/uploadImage.dart)
This code provides a function to upload an image to Firebase Storage in Flutter. It takes a base64-encoded jpeg image string as input and returns the URL of the uploaded image.
### [Delete Document Reference From User's Document's List](https://github.com/pippoberto/Dart-Functions/blob/main/deleteTopicFromUsers.dart)

## Dependencies

Each Dart function may have its own specific dependencies. It is important to review the code and documentation of each function to identify any dependencies and ensure they are included in your Flutter project.
