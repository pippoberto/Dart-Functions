# Dart Functions

Here I will ad some dart scripts that I use in the developing of Flutterflow Apps

### [Geographic Distance Calculator](https://github.com/pippoberto/Dart-Functions/blob/main/calculateDistance.dart)
This code provides a function to calculate the distance between two geographic positions on the Earth's surface using the Haversine formula. The Haversine formula is commonly used to calculate distances between two points on a sphere, such as the Earth.
### [Random Number Generator](https://github.com/pippoberto/Dart-Functions/blob/main/randomNumber.dart)
This code provides a function to generate a random number between 1 and 2147483647 (the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer in Dart). 
I used it to generate a random seed for image generation with some stable diffusion APIs.
